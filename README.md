# DAG-Based Pharmaceutical Traceability Simulation

This dataset simulates 1,000 NFC scan transactions for a DAG-anchored pharmaceutical traceability system. Each row represents a transaction event with environmental, identity, and cryptographic attributes.

## Files
- `simulated_scan_output.csv`: Output dataset with 1,000 samples
- `dag_sim.py`: Python script to regenerate the dataset
- `dag_simulation_notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter version for reproducibility

## How to Run
```
python dag_sim.py
```

All outputs will be written in the current directory.
